# Appendix VII. External Extension References

In SOLARNET FITS files, in keywords that have no special function within the official FITS/WCS framework, references to other extensions may be in the form of _external extension references_, e.g.:

```none
VAR_KEYS= '../auxiliary/s35837r001-aux.fits;VAR_KEY_DATA;TEMPERATURE[He_I]'
```

This means that the file with a relative path of `'../auxiliary/'` and a file name of `'s35837r001-aux.fits'` contains a binary table with `EXTNAME``='VAR_KEY_DATA'`, containing a column with `TTYPEn``='TEMPERATURE[He_I]'` which holds the data for the variable keyword `TEMPERATURE`. The path to the referenced file (`s35837r001-aux.fits`) is relative to the path of the referencing file.

In general terms, external extension references have the form `'<relative-path>/<filename>;<extname>'` and are drop-in replacements wherever plain extension names may be used. The relative path must always start with either './' or '../'. In the example above, the external extension reference is followed by a column name, just as if the external extension reference was a regular extension name. When looking up the file to locate the referenced extension, the software should allow for any file name variations due to compression (e.g., endings like .gz and .zip).

**Placeholder extensions**

Of course, it may be that the end user does not have the file containing the external extension available. To partially amend this situation, it is possible to have a placeholder extension in the same file as the referring extension, containing the full header of the referenced extension but having only a degenerate data cube (i.e., `NAXISn``=1`). The `EXTNAME` of the placeholder extension must be identical to the `EXTNAME` of the true external extension (i.e., `'VAR_KEY_DATA'` in the example above). The data dimensions of the true external extension should then be given in `XDIMNAn``=NAXISn` of the true external extension.
