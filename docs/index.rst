Abstract
--------

Prior to these SOLARNET [#footnote1]_ recommendations, metadata descriptions of solar observations have been standardized only for space-based observations, but the standards have been mostly within a single mission at a time - at times with significant differences between different missions. Ground-based solar observations have typically not been made freely available to the general community, resulting in an even greater lack of standards for metadata descriptions. This situation makes it difficult to construct multi-instrument archives/virtual observatories, and makes it difficult to write generic data analysis tools. The metadata recommendations in this document aim to remedy this, to foster more collaboration and data sharing by acting as a common reference for generic analysis software and for ingestion into solar virtual observatories. As part of this, we also introduce a set of new, flexible mechanisms to represent metadata in FITS files (see the list of Appendices).

These recommendations are currently being followed by at least nine data pipelines [#footnote2]_ . *Please notify prits-group@astro.uio.no if you use these recommendations so your pipeline can be added to the list*. We also highly recommend that you ask to be put on our mailing list for occasional discussions and announcements of changes (prior to implementation in the document itself). This is important to ensure we do not implement changes that have already been "locked in".
