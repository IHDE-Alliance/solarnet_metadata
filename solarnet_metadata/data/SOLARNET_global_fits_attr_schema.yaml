  FILEVERP:
    data_type: str
    default: null
    description: File Version Pattern. The keyword FILEVERP (file version pattern) should be specified to highlight a version identifier included in the file name. E.g., a file named solo_SPICE_sit-V01-2395.fits and the subsequent version solo_SPICE_sit-V02-2395.fits should both have FILEVERP='solo_SPICE_sit-V*-2395.fits', where the asterisk identifies where the file version occurs in the file name. Using an asterisk means that the file version should be interpreted lexically, whereas a percentage sign should be used when the version number is not a fixed number of decimals. E.g., with file names file_V2.fits and file_V12.fits, using FILEVERP='file_V%.fits' would ensure that the second file recognized as having a higher version number (thus superseding the first file).
